- [ ] No errors in Render logs

## Frontend Deployment (Vercel)

### Step 1: Import Project
- [ ] Log in to Vercel
- [ ] Click "Add New..." → "Project"
- [ ] Import GitHub repository: `AnshXGrind/c`
- [ ] Authorize Vercel to access repository

### Step 2: Configure Project
- [ ] Framework Preset: `Next.js`
- [ ] Root Directory: `frontend`
- [ ] Build Command: `npm run build`
- [ ] Output Directory: `.next`
- [ ] Install Command: `npm install`

### Step 3: Environment Variables
- [ ] Add: `PYTHON_ML_SERVICE_URL` = `https://your-render-url.onrender.com`
- [ ] Add: `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_NAME` = `CareerAI`

### Step 4: Deploy Frontend
- [ ] Click "Deploy"
- [ ] Wait for deployment (2-5 minutes)
- [ ] Check build logs for any errors
- [ ] Copy your Vercel URL (e.g., `https://your-app.vercel.app`)

### Step 5: Frontend Verification
- [ ] Homepage loads successfully
- [ ] No console errors in browser (F12)
- [ ] Navigation works
- [ ] All pages load

## Connect Services

### Update Backend CORS
- [ ] Go to Render dashboard
- [ ] Open your service
- [ ] Go to "Environment" tab
- [ ] Update `CORS_ORIGINS` to: `https://your-app.vercel.app,https://*.vercel.app`
- [ ] Save changes
- [ ] Wait for service to redeploy (1-2 minutes)

## End-to-End Testing

### Test Resume Analysis
- [ ] Go to `https://your-app.vercel.app/analyze`
- [ ] Upload a test PDF/DOCX resume
- [ ] Select target job role
- [ ] Click "Analyze Resume"
- [ ] Verify analysis results display correctly
- [ ] Check for no errors in browser console
- [ ] Check Render logs for successful request

### Test Skills Gap
- [ ] Go to `/skills` page
- [ ] Upload resume
- [ ] Select target role
- [ ] Verify skills gap analysis works

### Test Career Roadmap
- [ ] Go to `/roadmap` page
- [ ] Enter skills and role
- [ ] Verify roadmap generation works

### Test All Features
- [ ] Resume analyzer works
- [ ] Skills gap analysis works
- [ ] Career roadmap works
- [ ] Resume comparison works (if implemented)
- [ ] No CORS errors
- [ ] No 404 errors
- [ ] Fast response times (< 5 seconds)

## Performance Verification

### Frontend (Vercel)
- [ ] Page loads in < 2 seconds
- [ ] No build warnings in Vercel logs
- [ ] Lighthouse score > 80 (optional)

### Backend (Render)
- [ ] API responds in < 3 seconds
- [ ] Health check responds quickly
- [ ] No memory errors in logs
- [ ] No timeout errors

## Post-Deployment

### Documentation
- [ ] Update README.md with live URLs
- [ ] Document any deployment issues encountered
- [ ] Save environment variables securely

### Monitoring Setup
- [ ] Set up Vercel analytics (optional)
- [ ] Monitor Render service health
- [ ] Set up error alerts (optional)

### Optional Enhancements
- [ ] Add custom domain to Vercel
- [ ] Add custom domain to Render
- [ ] Set up SSL certificates (auto with both platforms)
- [ ] Configure CDN (Vercel includes this)

## Troubleshooting

### If Backend Fails
- [ ] Check Render logs for errors
- [ ] Verify build command ran successfully
- [ ] Check Python dependencies installed
- [ ] Verify spaCy model downloaded
- [ ] Check environment variables set correctly

### If Frontend Fails
- [ ] Check Vercel build logs
- [ ] Verify `PYTHON_ML_SERVICE_URL` is set
- [ ] Check for TypeScript errors
- [ ] Verify package.json dependencies

### If CORS Errors
- [ ] Verify `CORS_ORIGINS` in Render includes Vercel URL
- [ ] Check Render service redeployed after CORS change
- [ ] Verify Vercel URL is correct (with https://)
- [ ] Clear browser cache

### If 500 Errors
- [ ] Check Render logs for Python errors
- [ ] Verify file upload size < 10MB
- [ ] Check file format is PDF or DOCX
- [ ] Verify spaCy model is loaded

## Success Criteria

✅ **Your deployment is successful when:**

1. Frontend loads without errors
2. Can upload and analyze a resume
3. Analysis results display correctly
4. No CORS or network errors
5. Response times are acceptable
6. Both services show healthy status
7. All features work end-to-end

## Rollback Plan

If deployment fails:
1. Revert to previous Git commit
2. Redeploy from Vercel/Render dashboard
3. Check this checklist for missed steps
4. Review error logs carefully
5. Test locally first before redeploying

## Cost Monitoring

### Free Tier Limits
- **Render Free:** 750 hours/month, sleeps after 15min inactivity
- **Vercel Free:** 100GB bandwidth/month, unlimited requests

### Watch For
- [ ] Render service uptime
- [ ] Vercel bandwidth usage
- [ ] Cold start delays on Render (first request ~30s)

## Next Steps After Deployment

1. [ ] Share your live URL
2. [ ] Gather user feedback
3. [ ] Monitor error rates
4. [ ] Plan feature additions
5. [ ] Consider upgrading to paid tiers for better performance
