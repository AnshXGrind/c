ANALYSIS GUIDELINES:
- If Skills Match < 50%: Emphasize technical skill gaps
- If Experience Relevance < 50%: Highlight experience alignment issues

Example output:
[
  "Technical skills match is only 35%, indicating the resume lacks key technologies mentioned in the job description such as Python and AWS.",
  "Experience relevance score of 42% suggests previous roles don't align closely with the target position's responsibilities.",
  "Missing critical skills: Docker, Kubernetes, and CI/CD which are essential for this DevOps role."
